    <h3>Welcome to the New Life Training Center (NLTC) website!</h3>
    
    <p align="justify">Knowing that you have a desire to know more about God’s will, ways and His Word, we have launched this website to make it easier for you to explore and to know more about NTC, and if it is the right place for you.</p>
    <p>As NTC embarks on its 14th school year in June 2015, it has been consistently birthing a new breed of believers who are:
      <ul>
        <li>Growing in faith, love, abiding in grace, and understanding His glory.</li>
        <li>Seeking, loving and serving Christ.</li>
        <li>Humbled by His presence, yet bold and confident concerning their identity in Christ.</li>
        <li>Sensitive to the leading of the Holy Ghost.</li>
        <li>Unceasingly passionate about Christ, and prayerfully hungry for more of God, and,</li>
        <li>Compassionate to share the gospel story.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">If you desire to deepen your walk and intimacy with Christ, and learn of the many blessings, promises, and provisions written in the Word of God, we invite you to come in, take that first step, and apply as a student at NTC.</p>
    <p align="justify">Hope to see you in our classes very soon.</p><br />
    
    Shalom! <br /><br />
